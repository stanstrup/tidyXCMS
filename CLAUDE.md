# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an R package project named `tidyXCMS`, providing a tidy
interface for XCMS metabolomics data processing.

## Project Task Management

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses a structured task management system to
minimize token usage:

- **`instructions.md`**: Contains ONLY current/active tasks. Keep this
  file as lightweight as possible.
- **`completed_tasks.md`**: Archive of all completed tasks with detailed
  documentation.
- **`future_tasks.md`**: Long-term development roadmap and planned
  features.

When working on tasks: 1. Check `instructions.md` for current work 2.
Move completed tasks to `completed_tasks.md` with details 3. Keep
`instructions.md` minimal to reduce token consumption 4. Reference other
files for context rather than duplicating information

## R Package Development Commands

### Package Setup and Building

``` r
# Install development dependencies
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "usethis"))

# Build package documentation from roxygen comments
devtools::document()

# Install the package locally
devtools::install()

# Build package bundle
devtools::build()

# Check package (runs R CMD check)
devtools::check()
```

### Testing

``` r
# Run all tests (can be slow)
devtools::test()

# Run a specific test file (PREFERRED - faster for development)
testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/test-filename.R")

# Run tests with coverage
covr::package_coverage()
```

**IMPORTANT**: When working on specific functions, ALWAYS use
[`testthat::test_file()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/test_file.html)
to run only the relevant test file. Running all tests with
`devtools::test()` takes much longer than necessary.

### Development Workflow

``` r
# Load package for interactive development
devtools::load_all()

# Create new function/data documentation
usethis::use_r("function_name")

# Add test file
usethis::use_test("function_name")

# Add package dependency
usethis::use_package("package_name")
```

## R Package Structure

When creating R package files, follow this structure:

- `DESCRIPTION` - Package metadata and dependencies
- `NAMESPACE` - Package namespace (auto-generated by roxygen2)
- `R/` - R source code files
- `man/` - Documentation files (auto-generated by roxygen2)
- `tests/testthat/` - Unit tests
- `vignettes/` - Long-form documentation
- `data/` - Package datasets
- `inst/` - Additional files to be installed
- `dev-docs/` - Research documentation and implementation guides (not
  part of package, ignored by R CMD build)

## Code Style

The project follows standard R package conventions: - Use 2 spaces for
indentation (configured in .Rproj file) - Strip trailing whitespace
(configured in .Rproj file) - Auto-append newline to files (configured
in .Rproj file) - Use UTF-8 encoding

## Testing Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: All functions MUST have comprehensive tests: - Test
compatibility with both XCMSnExp and XcmsExperiment objects - Even if
examples/vignettes focus on XcmsExperiment, tests must verify XCMSnExp
works - Write tests in `tests/testthat/test-*.R` files - Use
[`testthat::test_file()`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/test_file.html)
to run individual test files - Ensure all major code paths are covered

## Bioconductor Parallel Processing

**IMPORTANT**: Always use
[`SerialParam()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/BiocParallel/man/SerialParam-class.html)
for example code and tests:

``` r
library(BiocParallel)

# Always include BPPARAM = SerialParam() for functions that support it:
xdata <- readMsExperiment(spectraFiles = files, BPPARAM = SerialParam())
xdata <- findChromPeaks(xdata, param = cwp, BPPARAM = SerialParam())

# Note: groupChromPeaks does NOT have BPPARAM parameter
xdata <- groupChromPeaks(xdata, param = pdp)
```

**Why SerialParam?** - **Faster for small datasets**: Avoids parallel
processing overhead - **Eliminates warnings**: Prevents “‘package:stats’
may not be available” warnings - **Cleaner output**: No parallel-related
messages - **Better for reproducibility**: Consistent behavior across
systems

**When to use SerialParam:** - All test files (`tests/testthat/`) - All
vignettes and examples - Any code with small sample sizes (\< 20 samples
typically)

**Which functions support BPPARAM:** - ✅ `readMsExperiment()` -
supports BPPARAM - ✅ `findChromPeaks()` - supports BPPARAM - ❌
`groupChromPeaks()` - does NOT support BPPARAM - ❌ `adjustRtime()` -
does NOT support BPPARAM

**Note**: Users can still use parallel processing in production by
omitting BPPARAM or setting their own parallel backend.

- **Original Discussion**: <https://github.com/sneumann/xcms/issues/551>

## Important Conventions

- Follow XCMS conventions for object types and methods
- Maintain compatibility with both XCMSnExp and xcmsExperiment objects
- Write comprehensive roxygen2 documentation
- Add examples (even if marked `\dontrun`)
- When tasks are completed, move them to `completed_tasks.md`

## Git Workflow

- Default branch: `main`
- **ALWAYS use semantic-release commit message format** (conventional
  commits):
  - `feat:` - New feature (triggers minor version bump)
  - `fix:` - Bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
  - `docs:` - Documentation changes only
  - `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
  - `test:` - Adding or updating tests
  - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
  - Example: `feat: add tidy interface for peak detection`
- GitHub Actions will automatically:
  - Run R CMD check on push/PR
  - Deploy pkgdown site on push to main
  - Create releases via semantic-release based on commit messages
- Always commit with co-authorship footer when using Claude Code

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Before committing changes, ALWAYS run these checks in
order:

### 0. Update DESCRIPTION (if needed)

When modifying functions, check if DESCRIPTION needs updates: - Add new
package dependencies to `Imports:` if using new packages - Update
`Suggests:` for optional dependencies (testing, vignettes) - Ensure all
imported packages are listed

### 1. Regenerate Documentation

``` r
# Update NAMESPACE and .Rd files from roxygen2 comments
roxygen2::roxygenize()
```

This ensures all function documentation and imports are up to date.

### 2. R CMD Check

``` r
# Check package for errors, warnings, and notes
devtools::check()
```

Fix all errors and warnings before committing. Address notes if
relevant.

### 3. Build pkgdown Site

``` r
# Load all package code
devtools::load_all()

# Build pkgdown site locally
pkgdown::build_site()
```

Check for: - No errors during site build - All vignettes render
correctly - All function documentation displays properly - No broken
links or missing references

Only commit after all three checks pass successfully.

### 4. Reinstall Package

``` r
# Reinstall the package to ensure all changes are properly loaded
devtools::install()
```

This ensures the package is fully functional after your changes.

### 5. Commit Changes

After all checks pass, commit your changes using semantic-release
format: - Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.) -
Always include co-authorship footer when using Claude Code - Example:

``` bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add new tidy interface function

```

## Pre-Push Checklist

After committing, verify everything is working before pushing to
GitHub: - Ensure `devtools::check()` passes with no errors/warnings -
Ensure
[`pkgdown::build_site()`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_site.html)
completes without errors - Review git status to ensure no unintended
files are included

## Task Management

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT start working on new tasks from instructions.md
unless explicitly told to do so by the user. Wait for the user to give
the go-ahead before proceeding with tasks.

**CRITICAL**: Make commits frequently after completing each task or
logical unit of work: - Commit after each completed task from
instructions.md - Don’t batch multiple tasks into one commit - Use
semantic commit format for each commit (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.) - This
provides better granularity and makes it easier to track changes -
Example workflow: 1. Complete task 1 → commit 2. Complete task 2 →
commit 3. Complete task 3 → commit etc.
